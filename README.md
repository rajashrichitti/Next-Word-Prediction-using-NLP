# Next-Word-Prediction-using-NLP


This project focuses on "Next Word Prediction" using natural language techniques and machine learning models. The project explores the use of N-gram models as well as a deep learning model called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for predicting the next word in a given sequence of text.

The models are evaluated and tested on two datasets, namely "alice.txt" and "train.json," both of which are publicly available on Kaggle. By utilizing these datasets, the project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the implemented models in accurately predicting the next word in a given context.

Additionally, the project provides the option for manual prediction, allowing users to input their own text and predict the next word based on the trained models. This feature enables users to interactively test the performance and accuracy of the models.

In summary, this project showcases the application of natural language techniques and machine learning models for "Next Word Prediction," providing insights into the effectiveness of N-gram models and LSTM for this task. The associated repository contains the code implementation, datasets, and further details for reference and exploration.
